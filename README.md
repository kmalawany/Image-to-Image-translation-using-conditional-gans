# Image-to-Image-translation-using-conditional-gans
### Implementation for pix2pix model based on keras code examples 

<ul>
<li>A dataset of paired images of map label and facade was used</li>
<li>Generator architecture is based on Unet architecture</li>
<li>discriminator is based on Patch-gans</li>
<li>Implemented custom training loop</li>
